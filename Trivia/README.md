#  Trivia Game

A simple Python terminal-based quiz game that asks random computer-related questions.
Test your knowledge and see how many you can get right! ðŸŽ¯

## Features

* Randomly selects 5 questions from a predefined question bank


* Compares user input with correct answers (case-insensitive)

* Displays correct/incorrect feedback instantly

* Shows your total score at the end

* Easy to customize â€” just add or remove questions in the dictionary


## How It Works

The program stores all questions and answers in a Python dictionary.

It randomly selects a subset of those questions using random.sample().

You type your answers directly into the terminal.

The program checks if your answer matches and updates your score.

At the end, it prints your final score out of the total number of questions asked.

## Requirements

Python 3.6+

No external libraries required â€” uses only the built-in ```random``` module.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this project folder.

2. Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the same directory.

3. Run the game:

```
4. Answer the questions as they appear.

5. Your score will be displayed at the end!
