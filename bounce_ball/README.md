# 🟢 Pygame Physics Box – Bouncing Ball


This project is a beginner-friendly physics simulation built using **Python and Pygame**.  
It demonstrates how a ball moves and bounces inside a boxed area using basic physics concepts such as velocity, collision detection, and screen coordinates.

The main goal of this project is to **learn physics programming step by step**, focusing on understanding how movement and collisions actually work instead of relying on game engines or shortcuts.

## ✨ Features

- Pygame window with a centered box
- Four walls created using `pygame.Rect`
- Ball movement using horizontal and vertical velocity
- Accurate wall collision detection
- Smooth bouncing without sticking or vibration
- Consistent motion using frame rate control

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pygame 2.6 or higher
- Linux, Windows, or macOS

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

1️⃣ Install pygame (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Run the game:

```bash
python bouncing_ball.py
```


## Example Output

- A window opens with a square box centered on the screen
- A ball moves inside the box
- The ball bounces smoothly off all four walls without leaving the box
