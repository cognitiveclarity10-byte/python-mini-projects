A simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer and determine the winner based on the classic rules.

## Features

The game allows the user to choose between Rock (R), Paper (P), or Scissors (S).

The computer randomly selects its choice.

The game will tell you whether you've won, lost, or if it's a draw.

The program can be run multiple times without restarting the script.

Includes basic error handling for invalid input.

## Requirements

Python3

## How to Run the Game

### Running Directly

To play the game, you can run the game.py file directly from the terminal.

```
 python3 rock_paper_scissor.py
```

This will start the game and ask you if you want to play. If you choose "Yes", it will prompt you to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will make a random selection, and the result will be displayed.
